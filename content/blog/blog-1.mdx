Quillaborn is live — but for now, it’s all about the public pages and our waitlist.  
We’re inviting early supporters to sign up and help shape what comes next.

## How We Got Here

It started with a conversation between father and son.  
One with a spark for the art world, the other with the tech skills to bring an idea to life.

We saw the gap:  
- Artists struggling to find the right collaborators  
- Creative communities scattered and messy  
- Great ideas going unfinished because the right people never met

Quillaborn was our answer — a platform where creators could connect with purpose, not just luck.

## Step One: Going Public

After weeks of planning, designing, and refining, the public-facing site is live:
- **Home page** — a clear vision of what Quillaborn stands for  
- **How it Works** — our promise to creators, broken into simple steps  
- **Pricing ** — transparent, with room to grow  
- **Join the Waitlist** — the first gateway into the community  
- **Contact** — to get support and reach out with questions 
- **Boring Stuff** — terms and policy 

You can [join the waitlist here](/#waitlist) to get early access when we open the doors.

## Why a Waitlist?

We want to build Quillaborn with the community, not just for the community.  
A waitlist lets us:
- Invite early testers in manageable groups  
- Collect feedback before opening fully  
- Give our first supporters a real voice in the platform’s direction

## What’s Next

While the public pages are now live, we’re already deep into:
- Designing the **onboarding flow** for new members  
- Prototyping the **dashboard** where creators will manage their projects  
- Laying the foundation for **profile pages** to showcase work

We’ll share those updates as soon as they’re ready — and if you’re on the waitlist, you’ll be the first to see them.

Quillaborn is just getting started.  
And we can’t wait to create this space with you.
