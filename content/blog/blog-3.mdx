This weekend was one of those sprints where everything just seemed to click. We pushed through a big list of features and came out the other side with an app that’s starting to feel more and more alive.

**Here’s what we shipped:**
- ✅ Preset avatar selection for profiles  
- ✅ Private Explore page for logged-in users  
- ✅ Public Explore page for profiles that opt in  
- ✅ Initial settings interface with privacy controls  
- ✅ Security-first defaults (everything private until you choose otherwise)  
- ✅ Bug fixes and deployment of the latest version  

**First up: Avatars.** Profiles now come with a set of preset avatars you can choose from. It’s a small touch, but it instantly makes the app feel more personal. And yes — the ability to upload your own avatar is absolutely on the roadmap.

**Sneak Peek Coming Soon** — Our co-founder Jake is working on new avatar designs, and we’ll be asking you to vote on your favorites.

**Next: The Explore Pages.**  
We now have *two* versions:

- **Private Explore** — Available only to logged-in users, showing public details like username, display name, role, and interests. It’s the easiest way to find and connect with other creators on Quillaborn.
- **Public Explore** — For users who choose to enable a public profile. This allows anyone with the link to see who you are and get a sense of our growing community. Interaction features (like posting and commenting) will come later.

**Settings & Privacy.**  
We set up the first version of the settings interface so you can manage profile visibility (public or private). Everything is *private by default* — and you choose what to share. Security is a top priority, and this is just the beginning of more controls and customization.

**Behind the Scenes.**  
There were a few late-night bug fixes that delayed deployment by about an hour, but the latest version is now live. We even did a demo for Jake, and his reaction was priceless — he’s already sketching avatar concepts that we think you’ll love.
