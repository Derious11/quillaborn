I started sometime after dinner and before i knew it the clocked rolled past 12am. The wife and kid sound asleep, dog snoring on the floor beside me. That’s what happens when you’re chasing a stubborn bug — time slips away.

The past few weeks have been a blur of **late night coding**, watching the pieces of Quillaborn slowly click into place. First up was the **signup process**. It started as just a simple form, but I wanted it to feel welcoming — like the first page of a brand-new notebook. Now, when someone signs up, they don’t just create an account… they step into a space built for their creativity.

Then came the **dashboard**. I can’t tell you how satisfying it was the first time it loaded without breaking. That page is now the heart of the Quillaborn experience — a place where projects live, messages appear, and your creative world starts to take shape.

After that, I dove into **profiles**. Not just a username and avatar, but a place that feels personal. Somewhere you can share your style, your work, and maybe spark a connection with someone who gets what you’re creating.

There were moments — like when the dashboard finally loaded at 2:13 AM and I actually said “yes!” out loud — that made the exhaustion worth it. Each fix, each tweak, is a step closer to opening the doors.

The nights are long, but we’re building something worth staying up for.
