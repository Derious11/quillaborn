Some updates glide. This one wrestled back. We pushed hard, broke plenty, and got it working—and the result is worth it.

**Here’s what we shipped:**
- ✅ **Admin page** to manage users (roles, visibility, cleanup)
- ✅ **Post on your own profile timeline** (share updates, WIPs, wins)
- ✅ **Cleaner signup flow** with fewer steps and clearer guidance
- ✅ **Login on the landing page** (top-right) for **early access** members
- ✅ A handful of bug fixes after some heroic late-night debugs

**Why it matters.**  
Profiles can finally *speak*. You can post quick updates, share links, and keep your followers in the loop—right from your profile. Admin tools help us keep the growing community tidy and safe. And the new signup/login flow removes friction: easier to join, faster to get back in.

**Behind the scenes (aka the messy part).**  
We shipped fast and tripped a few wires. Deploy, break, fix, repeat. The good news: the sharp edges are smoothed out, performance is steady, and the path from “I’m curious” to “I’m posting” is much cleaner.
