The foundation is here: **boards and cards** are now live! ðŸŽ‰  
You can finally start organizing projects visually, moving work around, and setting the stage for deeper collaboration.

**Hereâ€™s what we shipped:**
- âœ… **Boards** â€” create project boards to keep everything organized  
- âœ… **Cards** â€” add, edit, and move cards as tasks or ideas  
- âœ… **Sortable lists** â€” drag and drop items to reorder them  
- âœ… **Card details** â€” assign people, add comments, and keep context in one place  

**Why it matters.**  
This unlocks the core workflow of Quillaborn: turning ideas into organized, trackable steps. Boards and cards are the canvas â€” and everything else will build on top.

âš¡ **Coming next:** Chat, File Manager, and Notifications are in the works. Soon youâ€™ll be able to message teammates, upload files, and stay on top of updates without leaving the app.

**Behind the scenes.**  
Getting boards and cards to *feel right* meant a lot of tinkering with drag-and-drop, state updates, and UI polish. It wasnâ€™t always smooth â€” a few late-night bug hunts had us questioning reality â€” but now moving a card feels snappy and natural.

**Whatâ€™s possible now:**
- Organize your work visually with boards  
- Move cards around as projects evolve  
- Collaborate by assigning and commenting on cards  
- Get ready for the next wave of features
