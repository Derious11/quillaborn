Big milestone this week: the social layer of Quillaborn just landed. ðŸŽ‰  

You can now **follow other creators** â€” and they can follow you back. Even better, we shipped the ability to **send messages and chat**, so you can finally start real conversations inside the platform.

**Hereâ€™s what we shipped:**
- âœ… Follow creators (build your network)  
- âœ… Followers/following lists  
- âœ… Direct messages + chat view  
- âœ… Cleaned up notifications and bug fixes  

**Why it matters.**  
Quillaborn is about connection. Profiles and posts gave creators a voice, but now you can listen, respond, and start building relationships. Following helps you keep track of people whose work inspires you. Chat makes it easy to spark collaborations without leaving the platform.

ðŸ’¬ **Try it out** â€” Follow a creator and send them a message today. Then tell us what feels smooth (and what doesnâ€™t).

**Behind the scenes.**  
This update touched a lot of moving parts. We wanted chat to feel lightweight but reliable, with a smooth flow between messages and profile views. It took a few late-night sprints and some bug hunts, but now itâ€™s live â€” and ready for you to use.

**Whatâ€™s possible now:**
- Build your own creative network inside Quillaborn  
- Start conversations that could lead to projects  
- Share encouragement, feedback, or ideas instantly
