Welcome to the very first entry in the **Quillaborn Build Log**!  
Weâ€™re documenting how weâ€™re designing and building a platform for artists, writers, and creators to **connect, collaborate, and grow together**.

## Why Weâ€™re Building Quillaborn
Every day, talented creators are sharing work online â€” but real collaboration is harder to find. Social platforms reward fast scrolls and shallow engagement, not meaningful projects. We wanted to build something different:  
- A **community-first platform** where creativity is valued.  
- Tools to **start and manage projects** with other creators.  
- A space where **art and stories** can evolve through collaboration.  

## What Makes Quillaborn Different
- **Focused on creation, not algorithms.** Your work doesnâ€™t get buried under noise.  
- **Project-based structure.** Collaborations are at the heart of the platform.  
- **Inclusive community.** Writers, illustrators, and dreamers all belong here.  

## Whatâ€™s Next
Weâ€™re still in **early access**, and weâ€™d love your input. Join the waitlist and help shape the future of Quillaborn.
